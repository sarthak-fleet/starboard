# AGENTS.md — Starboard

> Agent bootloader. Concise by design — links to [`docs/`](docs/index.md) for
> depth. Also follow the shared fleet standard at [`fleet/AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/sarthakagrawal927/fleet/blob/main/AGENTS.md):
> treat this repository as owned product code, protect production stability,
> keep changes scoped, verify work, and record durable follow-up tasks when
> something remains incomplete or blocked.

## Purpose

GitHub stars organizer — sync, tag, and semantic vector search across your
starred repositories. Fleet-aware recommendations, discovery, radar, alerts,
and shareable insight reports. Live at
[starboard.codevetter.com](https://starboard.codevetter.com). See
[docs/product/overview.md](docs/product/overview.md).

## Stack (one-liner)

Next.js 16 (App Router, React 19) + TypeScript, Turso (libSQL, raw SQL — no ORM)
with `F32_BLOB(768)` vectors, NextAuth v5 beta (GitHub OAuth), nuqs + SWR,
Cloudflare Workers AI `@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5`, deployed to Cloudflare
Workers via `@opennextjs/cloudflare`. pnpm.

## Essential commands

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev               # next dev → http://localhost:3000
pnpm build             # next build --webpack
pnpm build:cf          # OpenNext Cloudflare build (production path)
pnpm deploy:cf         # build:cf + wrangler deploy (manual; CI auto-deploys on push to main)
pnpm typecheck         # tsc --noEmit
pnpm test              # vitest run
pnpm test:coverage     # vitest run --coverage
pnpm test:e2e          # playwright
pnpm lint              # biome check .
pnpm db:migrate        # tsx src/db/migrate.ts (applies schema.sql + embedding dim self-heal)
pnpm db:seed-popular   # cold-seed popular repos (≥5k stars) — used by daily GH Action
pnpm db:seed-embeddings# backfill repo_embeddings
pnpm fleet:extract-projects  # regenerate data/fleet-projects.generated.json
pnpm docs:check        # validate docs/ links + structure
pnpm docs:dev          # blume dev (local docs site; requires pnpm add -D blume)
pnpm docs:build        # blume build (presentation only; not part of production build)
```

## Critical constraints

- **Do not commit secrets.** `.env`, `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` are gitignored.
  Verify `.gitignore` before any push.
- **Do not push, deploy, run migrations, or open PRs without explicit user
  approval.** Make changes locally and leave them staged/committed for review.
- **Embedding dimension contract** — `EMBEDDING_DIM=768` is pinned across three
  files that must change together: `src/lib/embeddings.ts`,
  `src/db/schema.sql`, `src/db/migrate.ts`. The migrate runner self-heals drift
  (`ensureEmbeddingDimension()`); do not hand-edit the Turso `repo_embeddings`
  table. See
  [docs/architecture/decisions/0006-embedding-dimension-contract.md](docs/architecture/decisions/0006-embedding-dimension-contract.md)
  and
  [docs/operations/runbooks/embedding-dimension-drift.md](docs/operations/runbooks/embedding-dimension-drift.md).
- **`@libsql/client/web` import is load-bearing.** `src/db/index.ts` must import
  from `@libsql/client/web` (not `@libsql/client`) and lazy-init via a Proxy.
  Using the default import re-breaks the Worker. The CF build must use
  `--webpack` (not Turbopack). See
  [docs/architecture/decisions/0003-opennext-libsql-bundling.md](docs/architecture/decisions/0003-opennext-libsql-bundling.md).
- **NextAuth v5 beta** — `trustHost: true` is hardcoded in `src/lib/auth.ts`
  (env-driven `AUTH_TRUST_HOST` was unreliable). Both `AUTH_URL` and
  `NEXTAUTH_URL` must be set in `wrangler.jsonc` vars. See
  [docs/architecture/decisions/0002-nextauth-v5-beta.md](docs/architecture/decisions/0002-nextauth-v5-beta.md).
- **No ORM.** Raw SQL via `@libsql/client`. Schema in `src/db/schema.sql`;
  apply with `pnpm db:migrate`.
- **Generated files — do not hand-edit:** `agent-edge.mjs`, `worker.mjs`,
  `cloudflare-env.d.ts`, `data/fleet-projects.generated.json`. See
  [docs/development/conventions.md](docs/development/conventions.md).
- **Pre-push hook** (`.husky/pre-push`) runs Biome on changed files and scans
  tracked files for common secret patterns. Re-stage modified files and retry.
- **Do not modify agent skills, plugins, or agent-profile directories**
  (`.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.symphony/`, `.clawpatch/`, any `SKILL.md`). They are
  tooling, not product code.

## Documentation navigation

- **[docs/index.md](docs/index.md)** — canonical documentation hub. Start there.
- **[STATUS.md](STATUS.md)** — short current-state view (objective, active work,
  blockers, next steps).
- **[PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md)** — deeper product status (fleet
  tooling reads this filename).
- **[README.md](README.md)** — product readme for humans landing in the repo.
- **[docs/product/](docs/product/)** — purpose, features, surfaces.
- **[docs/architecture/](docs/architecture/)** — overview, data flow, ADRs.
- **[docs/development/](docs/development/)** — setup, commands, conventions,
  testing, OpenSpec.
- **[docs/operations/](docs/operations/)** — deploy, env, CI/CD, jobs, runbooks.
- **[docs/knowledge/](docs/knowledge/)** — current lessons, external references,
  failed approaches.
- **[docs/archive/](docs/archive/)** — historical records (pre-split ADRs,
  plans, retros, security audit, OSS evaluation).
- **[openspec/](openspec/)** — spec-driven change workflow tooling and archived
  change proposals. See [docs/development/openspec.md](docs/development/openspec.md).
- **[public/](public/)** — runtime agent-indexing surfaces (`llms.txt`,
  `index.md`, `api-ai.json`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`). See
  [docs/product/surfaces.md](docs/product/surfaces.md).

## Documentation-maintenance rules

1. **Markdown in `docs/` is the source of truth.** Code and executable config
   remain authoritative for implementation details; docs explain *why*, not
   *what the code does line-by-line*.
2. **One home per fact.** Don't duplicate — link to the canonical home. If a
   fact moves, update links rather than copying.
3. **Prefer `docs/archive/` over deletion.** Move superseded docs with `git mv`,
   give them a dated filename, and prepend a one-line historical marker pointing
   at the current canonical doc. Preserve git rename history.
4. **Mark unresolved questions explicitly** with `TBD:` or an "Open questions"
   section. Do not invent answers.
5. **Keep pages focused** (150–300 lines). Split when a page grows beyond
   that.
6. **Validate before commit.** Run `pnpm docs:check` (or
   `node scripts/check-docs.mjs`) — it catches broken links, missing required
   sections, and files outside the canonical structure. CI runs it in
   `.github/workflows/docs.yml`.
7. **Blume is presentation only.** `blume.config.ts` renders `docs/`; never
   edit generated Blume output. Edit the Markdown and rebuild.

## Fleet guidance

<!-- FLEET-GUIDANCE:START -->

### Adding Tasks

- Add durable work items in SaaS Maker Cockpit Tasks when the task affects
  product behavior, deployment, user feedback, or fleet maintenance.
- Include the project slug, a concise title, acceptance criteria,
  priority/status, and links to relevant code, issues, traces, or dashboards.
- If task discovery starts locally in an editor or agent session, mirror the
  durable next step back into SaaS Maker before handoff.

### Using SaaS Maker

- Treat SaaS Maker as the system of record for project metadata, feedback,
  tasks, analytics, testimonials, changelog, and fleet visibility.
- Prefer API-first workflows through `fnd api`, the SDK, or widgets instead of
  one-off scripts when interacting with SaaS Maker features.
- Keep this agent file aligned with the project record when operating rules,
  integrations, or deployment conventions change.

### Free AI First

- Prefer free/local AI paths for routine development and analysis: the
  `free-ai` gateway, local models, provider free tiers, and cached context.
- Escalate to paid models only when complexity, correctness risk, or missing
  capability justifies the cost.
- Note any paid-AI use in the task or handoff when it materially affects cost,
  reproducibility, or future maintenance.
