## Embedding pipeline

### F32_BLOB is dimension-pinned at index creation — mismatches throw, not silently truncate

`libsql_vector_idx` embeds the dimension in the index metadata at `CREATE INDEX` time. Inserting a vector of a different length fails with "vector dimensions different: N != M". The error is raised at insert, not at query time, so a dimension change that passes all unit tests will still break production inserts until the index is dropped and recreated.

**Fix:** `migrate.ts` → `ensureEmbeddingDimension()` reads `PRAGMA table_info(repo_embeddings)`, parses the `F32_BLOB(N)` column type, and drops both the table and index if `N ≠ EMBEDDING_DIM`. The subsequent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` in `schema.sql` recreates them at the correct dimension.

**Commits:** `Fix seed workflow auth and embedding dimensions` (2026-05-23), `Fix runtime shim and embedding dimensions` (2026-05-16)

### The AI Gateway HTTP path can return doubled-dimension vectors

When `embedViaHttp()` is used (Node CLI / GH Actions path), the gateway can return vectors of length `EMBEDDING_DIM * 2` for some model/request combinations. The `normalizeEmbeddingDimensions()` function in `embeddings.ts` detects this (length is a clean multiple of `EMBEDDING_DIM`) and averages adjacent pairs to reduce back to `EMBEDDING_DIM`. This is a workaround, not the normal path — the binding path does not exhibit this behavior.

**Evidence:** `Normalize gateway embedding dimensions` commit (2026-05-23); `normalizeEmbeddingDimensions()` in `src/lib/embeddings.ts` lines 166–179.

---

### `generateEmbeddings()` throws on dimension mismatch — this is intentional

After normalization, if the vector length still does not equal `EMBEDDING_DIM`, the function throws with a message naming the model and both dimensions. This is by design: silent wrong-dimension inserts corrupt the index, so a loud failure is better. If you see this error, update all three pinned files together (`embeddings.ts`, `schema.sql`, `migrate.ts`).

---

### Batch size matters: BATCH_SIZE=50 for Workers AI

Workers AI has per-request limits. The embedding pipeline sends texts in batches of 50 (`BATCH_SIZE` in `embeddings.ts`). Larger batches fail silently or hit rate limits. The HTTP path adds exponential backoff (base 400 ms, 3 attempts) for 429 and 5xx responses.

## @libsql/client in Cloudflare Workers

### Must import `@libsql/client/web`, not `@libsql/client`

The default `@libsql/client` entry pulls in `better-sqlite3` native bindings for the Node sync path. In workerd, this fails at module resolution. The `/web` subpath (`src/db/index.ts`) exports only the HTTP/WebSocket client that workerd can run.

**Evidence:** `src/db/index.ts` line 1; commit message for `chore(cf): migrate from Vercel to Cloudflare Workers via opennext` documents the failed attempts before this fix.

---

### opennext-cloudflare 1.19 externalizes @libsql/client regardless of transpilePackages

Even with `transpilePackages: ["@libsql/client"]` in `next.config.ts`, OpenNext 1.19 was externalizing the package, causing a runtime module-not-found. The working combination is: `/web` subpath import + `transpilePackages` entry + webpack build path (`--webpack`, not Turbopack). All three are required.

**Evidence:** Commit message for `178a2be`; lines 24–26 of `next.config.ts` comment.

---

### Lazy-init the libsql client via a Proxy — do not construct at module load

Constructing `createClient()` at module top-level caused CI build failures because `TURSO_DATABASE_URL` is not set at build time. The Proxy pattern in `src/db/index.ts` defers client creation to the first method call, where env vars are always available.

**Evidence:** `fix(db): lazy-init libsql client to fix CI build` commit (2026-04-28); `src/db/index.ts`.

---

## NextAuth on Cloudflare Workers

### `trustHost: true` must be hardcoded — env-driven flag was unreliable

`AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true` set via `wrangler.jsonc` vars was not reliably read by NextAuth v5 in the Worker, causing cookie rejection on OAuth callbacks. Setting `trustHost: true` directly in the `NextAuth({...})` call in `src/lib/auth.ts` is the stable fix.

**Evidence:** `fix(auth): set AUTH_URL/NEXTAUTH_URL vars for prod cookie/redirect resolution` commit (2026-04-28); `src/lib/auth.ts` line 6.

---

### Both `AUTH_URL` and `NEXTAUTH_URL` must be set in wrangler.jsonc vars

NextAuth v5 reads `AUTH_URL` for the callback base URL; the legacy `NEXTAUTH_URL` is also read by some internal paths. Setting only one causes redirect or cookie domain mismatches in the deployed Worker.

**Evidence:** `wrangler.jsonc` `vars` block; commit `fix(auth): set AUTH_URL/NEXTAUTH_URL vars`.

---

## OpenNext / Cloudflare build

### CF Pages deploy pattern was broken for this app — required reverting to Workers

The project briefly tried deploying via CF Pages (`ci: migrate deploy from CF Workers to CF Pages`, 2026-04-25). The deploy workflow was broken for the opennext pattern and reverted one business day later (`ci: rewrite workflow for Workers deploy`, 2026-04-28). The Workers deploy pattern (`wrangler deploy`, `worker.mjs` entrypoint) is stable.

---

### Beasties-inlined critical CSS is lost without the incremental cache override

OpenNext's default runtime re-renders pages from `page.js` on each request, discarding the Beasties-processed HTML that has critical CSS inlined. Setting `incrementalCache: staticAssetsIncrementalCache` in `open-next.config.ts` makes the Worker serve the prerendered HTML from the assets binding instead.

**Evidence:** `open-next.config.ts` comment lines 4–11; `apply fleet Beasties + cache-wrapper pattern` commit.

---

### OG image route cannot use edge runtime on OpenNext Cloudflare

`next/og` uses the `ImageResponse` API. On OpenNext Cloudflare, marking the OG image route as `export const runtime = 'edge'` fails. Remove the `runtime` export and let OpenNext handle the route as a standard serverless function.

**Evidence:** `fix: opengraph-image cannot use edge runtime on OpenNext Cloudflare` commit (2026-05-xx); `wrangler.jsonc` `nodejs_compat` flag ensures the Node APIs needed by the default runtime are available.

---

## Vector search queries

### `vector_top_k` is global — user filtering happens after the ANN, not inside it

`vector_top_k('idx_repo_embeddings_vec', vector(?), K)` returns the K nearest rows globally across all users. To filter to a user's repos, a `JOIN user_repos ur ON ur.repo_id = re.repo_id WHERE ur.user_id = ?` is applied after the ANN call. This means `VEC_TOP_K=500` candidates are fetched even when a user has 100 starred repos. At current corpus size this is fine; if the seeded pool grows to 100k+ rows, a pre-filter or partitioned index will be needed.

**Evidence:** `src/app/api/stars/route.ts` lines 86–101.

---

### F32_BLOB is returned as a Buffer/Uint8Array from libsql — must use `vector_extract()` to get JSON

When reading an embedding back from Turso to use as a query vector, the raw `SELECT embedding FROM repo_embeddings` returns a binary Buffer, not a JSON array. `SELECT vector_extract(embedding) AS vec` returns the JSON string `[0.1, 0.2, ...]` that `vector()` in a subsequent query accepts.

**Evidence:** `src/app/api/repos/[repoId]/similar/route.ts` lines 70–75.

---

## Search

### FTS5 BM25 `rank` column is negative — ORDER BY rank ASC means best match first

FTS5's `bm25()` function returns negative scores (more negative = better match). The search query orders by `rank ASC` to surface best matches first. This is counterintuitive but correct for FTS5.

**Evidence:** `src/app/api/stars/route.ts` lines 56–76 (BM25 subquery).

---

### GitHub star lists have no official API — require HTML scraping

The GitHub "Starred lists" feature (organizing stars into named lists inside GitHub) has no official API endpoint. `src/lib/github-lists.ts` scrapes GitHub HTML to discover these lists. This is fragile and may break on GitHub layout changes.

**Evidence:** `agents.md` "GitHub star lists via HTML scraping (not official API)"; `src/lib/github-lists.ts`.
