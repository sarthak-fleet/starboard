# Starboard — Documentation Index

This folder is the canonical source of truth for Starboard's product,
architecture, operations, and durable knowledge. Markdown here is authoritative;
the [`blume.config.ts`](../blume.config.ts) at the repo root only renders it.

For a fast agent briefing, read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) first, then this index.

## Maintenance rules

1. **Markdown in `docs/` is the source of truth.** Code and executable config
   remain authoritative for implementation details; docs explain *why*, not
   *what the code does line-by-line*.
2. **One home per fact.** Don't duplicate a fact across files — link to its
   canonical home. If a fact moves, update links rather than copying.
3. **Prefer `archive/` over deletion.** When a doc is superseded, move it to
   `docs/archive/` with `git mv`, give it a dated filename, and prepend a
   one-line historical marker pointing at the current canonical doc. Preserve
   git rename history.
4. **Mark unresolved questions explicitly** with `TBD:` or an "Open questions"
   section. Do not invent answers.
5. **Keep pages focused** (150–300 lines). Split when a page grows beyond
   that.
6. **Validate before commit.** Run `pnpm docs:check` (or
   `node scripts/check-docs.mjs`) — it catches broken links, missing required
   sections, and files outside the canonical structure. CI runs it in
   `.github/workflows/docs.yml`.
7. **Blume is presentation only.** `blume.config.ts` renders `docs/`; never
   edit generated Blume output. Edit the Markdown and rebuild.

## What lives outside this folder

- [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) — concise agent bootloader (purpose, commands,
  constraints, navigation). Links here for depth.
- [`STATUS.md`](../STATUS.md) — short current-state view (objective, active
  work, blockers, next steps).
- [`PROJECT_STATUS.md`](../PROJECT_STATUS.md) — deeper product status (fleet
  tooling reads this filename).
- [`README.md`](../README.md) — product readme for humans landing in the repo.
- [`openspec/`](../openspec/) — spec-driven change workflow tooling and
  archived change proposals. See
  [development/openspec.md](development/openspec.md).
- [`public/`](../public/) — runtime agent-indexing surfaces (`llms.txt`,
  `index.md`, `api-ai.json`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`) served by the Worker.
  Documented in [product/surfaces.md](product/surfaces.md).
