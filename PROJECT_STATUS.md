# starboard — PROJECT STATUS

Last updated: 2026-07-13

## Why/What

Starboard turns a large GitHub star list into a searchable personal knowledge base. Active product surfaces: starred-repo dashboard with tags, collections, filters, and semantic search; fleet-aware **My Projects** recommendations; discovery and repo detail pages; radar maintainer signals; weekly alert inbox and digest payloads; and shareable read-only insight reports. Live: [starboard.codevetter.com](https://starboard.codevetter.com).

Out of scope: organization/team dashboards, non-GitHub providers, ATS features, and real-time push notifications.

## Dependencies

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| App | Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript |
| UI | Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, dark default |
| Data | Turso (libSQL) — raw SQL, no ORM |
| Auth | NextAuth v5 (GitHub OAuth, `read:user`) |
| Client state | SWR (data), nuqs (URL-backed filters/sort) |
| AI / search | Cloudflare Workers AI `@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5` (768d); optional `knowledgebase` Worker via service binding |
| Deploy | Cloudflare Workers via OpenNext (`@opennextjs/cloudflare`) |
| CI | GitHub Actions — push-to-main deploy + scheduled seed/enrich/embed |

**Local dev:** `pnpm install && cp .env.example .env.local && pnpm dev` → http://localhost:3000

**Key checks:** `pnpm test:coverage` · `pnpm build` · `pnpm build:cf` (Cloudflare path)

```
GitHub OAuth (NextAuth)
        │
        ▼
Star sync (ETag + HTML scrape for star lists) ──► Turso (users, repos, user_repos, tags, lists, comments, votes)
        │
        ├── Full-text + facet search (GET /api/stars)
        ├── Semantic search: knowledgebase Worker; lexical-only when shared RAG is unavailable
        ├── Fleet snapshot: data/fleet-projects.generated.json → My Projects scorer
        ├── Radar: maintainer/release signals → alert preferences + inbox
        └── Insight reports: slugged public snapshots (radar, recommendations, cleanup)
```

**Embedding contract:** `EMBEDDING_DIM=768` pinned across `src/lib/embeddings.ts`, `src/db/schema.sql`, and `src/db/migrate.ts` (`ensureEmbeddingDimension()` drops/recreates vector table on drift). Scheduled `db:migrate` before `db:seed-popular` heals dimension mismatches without manual surgery.

**Data model highlights:** tags stored as JSON arrays on `user_repos`; virtualized grid via `@tanstack/react-virtual`; GitHub access token in session for sync; project recommendations suppress packages already used by the target fleet project before ranking.

| Concern | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Hosting | Cloudflare Worker `starboard` via OpenNext |
| Database | Turso — apply schema with `pnpm db:migrate` |
| Secrets | `AUTH_SECRET`, `AUTH_GITHUB_ID`, `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET`, `TURSO_*`; `RAG_SERVICE_KEY`, `STARBOARD_RAG_INDEX_ID` for relevance RAG |
| Embedding model | `@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5` — change model + dimension in all three contract files together |
| Fleet snapshot | Refresh `data/fleet-projects.generated.json` after fleet `PROJECT_STATUS.md` / dependency changes |
| Scheduled jobs | GitHub Actions seed-popular runs `db:migrate` then `db:seed-popular` — primary self-heal for vector dimension drift |
| Deploy | `pnpm deploy:cf` or push to `main` (CI auto-deploy) |
| Smoke | `pnpm test` + `pnpm build`; for search/DB changes also `pnpm db:migrate` and `pnpm build:cf` |

## Timeline

- **2026-07-13** — Completed Star History + Tool Intelligence: Discover now supports stored 30-day growth ordering and detected-tool facets, tool enrichment reuses persisted AI/README-derived metadata before GitHub manifest requests, and the 5k+ seed walk has a hard per-run page bound with conflict-safe snapshot inserts and resumable cursors. Added route-level coverage for growth/tool queries and excluded linked fleet agent assets from Vitest discovery; 94 tests, typecheck, lint, and production build pass.
- **2026-07-11** — Scheduled seed reliability: GitHub search now retries transient network and 5xx failures with bounded exponential backoff, while alert preference fixtures include the current email opt-out default.
- **2026-07-02** — Added global try/catch error handler to OpenNext worker (`worker.mjs`).

| Phase | Milestone |
|-------|-----------|
| Foundation | GitHub OAuth (NextAuth v5), OpenNext Cloudflare deploy, core dashboard with sync, tags, collections, full-text search, virtual scroll |
| Repo intelligence | Repo detail (`/explore`), comments/votes, public shared lists, legal/marketing shell |
| Semantic search | knowledgebase Worker integration for relevance search; README-backed sync ingest; local embeddings retained for non-RAG Starboard features |
| Fleet recommendations | My Projects scorer against `fleet-projects.generated.json`, fixture-backed eval harness, OSS integration evaluation |
| Discovery & radar | Discover page, scheduled seed/enrich/embed, radar maintainer signals, stack builder, first-run UX and digest preview surfaces |
| Alerts & reports | Weekly alert inbox/preferences, digest payloads, shareable insight reports at stable public URLs |
| Ops hardening (2026-06-20) | `.env.example`, Vitest + Playwright path, pre-push lint, self-contained TypeScript/Astro landing for green CF builds |

## Features (shipped)

### Auth, sync, and core dashboard
- GitHub OAuth through NextAuth v5; Cloudflare Workers deployment via OpenNext documented and live.
- Manual sync on demand with added/removed diff feedback; ETag caching on GitHub star API calls.
- GitHub star-list ingestion via HTML scraping where no official API exists.
- Main dashboard: smart categories, custom colored tags, named collections, full-text search, language/category/tag/collection filters, sort (recently starred, most stars, recently updated, A-Z), grid/list toggle, virtual scroll for 1000+ repos.
- URL-shareable filter/sort state through nuqs.
- Repo detail (`/explore`): comments, votes, likes, similar repos, list assignment, tag picker.
- Public shared lists at `/lists/[slug]` with SSR and `list.json` export route.
- Legal/marketing shell: about, privacy, terms, sitemap, robots, OG image, security.txt, humans.txt, PWA manifest.

### Search and embeddings
- Workers AI embedding generation with runtime dimension assertion.
- Turso vector index path (`repo_embeddings`, cosine `libsql_vector_idx`) retained for non-RAG Starboard features such as similar repos, discover, and recommendations.
- Shared-RAG integration: when `RAG_SERVICE_KEY` and `STARBOARD_RAG_INDEX_ID` are set as Worker secrets/vars or local env, relevance search uses the fleet `knowledgebase` Worker with sync ingest for new repos; new repo RAG documents include full GitHub README text when available, fall back to repo metadata when unavailable, and are sent in bounded ingest batches. `src/__tests__/knowledgebase-rag.test.ts` covers README-only recall terms plus batch splitting so Starboard does not regress to description-only ingestion. If shared RAG is unavailable, relevance search falls back to lexical results instead of local vector search.
- `pnpm db:seed-embeddings` backfill script; embedding dimension guard in migrate runner.
- free-ai HTTP fallback for Node-based GitHub Actions embedding contexts.

### Fleet recommendations
- **My Projects** ranks saved/starred repos against checked-in fleet project snapshot (`data/fleet-projects.generated.json`).
- Deterministic scoring with optional embedding boosts; packages already in the target project suppressed before ranking.
- `pnpm fleet:extract-projects` regenerates fleet snapshot from local fleet repos.
- Fixture-backed recommendation eval harness: `src/lib/recommendation-eval.ts`, `src/__tests__/fixtures/recommendation-eval-fixture.ts`.
- OSS recommendation integrations evaluated in `docs/oss-integration-evaluation.md`.

### Discovery, radar, and intelligence surfaces
- Discover page and `/api/discover` for seeded popular repositories.
- Discover supports paginated 30-day growth ordering and detected-tool facets from indexed local snapshot/tool tables.
- Scheduled GitHub Actions seed/enrich/embed popular repos in Turso (`scripts/seed-popular.ts`, `pnpm db:seed-popular`).
- Radar page and `/api/radar` for maintainer/release-oriented signals.
- Star history and fastest-grower APIs/surfaces: `/api/repos/[repoId]/star-history`, `/api/growth`, Radar fastest-growers, and repo-detail mini history from stored `repo_star_snapshots`.
- Tool Intelligence: additive `repo_tools` index, `/api/tools`, `/api/repos/[repoId]/tools`, `/tools`, and `pnpm db:enrich-tools` for bounded SBOM/tree/manifest-based detection with source/confidence labels. Accuracy disclaimer is shown in-product because manifest/SBOM evidence is stronger than README/topic/metadata inference and C/C++ monorepos vary.
- Stack builder surface (`/stack-builder`, `/api/stack-builder`).
- SaaS Maker feedback, testimonials, and changelog widgets integrated.
- First-run UX, sample prioritized stars board, why-repo-is-hot explanations, GitHub permission trust note, stale-star cleanup proof, weekly digest preview surfaces (product/design loop shipped).

### Alerts and shareable reports
- Weekly repository alerts: opt-in lanes, in-app inbox (`/api/alerts/inbox`), preference API (`/api/alerts/preferences`).
- Weekly digest payload generation from radar/maintainer signals (`/api/alerts/weekly`, `/api/digest/weekly`).
- Shareable insight reports at stable public URLs (`/reports/[slug]`, `POST /api/reports`) for radar snapshots, project recommendation explanations, and cleanup digests.
- Share buttons wired on Radar, My Projects, and weekly cleanup digest flows.

### Ops and developer experience
- Checked-in `.env.example` documents required local variables without secrets.
- Vitest unit tests with v8 coverage thresholds (80% lines/functions/statements, 70% branches) on core logic modules (`src/lib/fleet-projects`, `recommendation-eval`, `search`, `stack-builder`, `starboard-rag-documents`, `release-radar`); Playwright e2e path documented in README.
- Pre-push lint hook.
- TypeScript config and Astro landing tooling made self-contained for green Cloudflare builds.

## Todo / Planned / Deferred / Blocked

### Planned
1. **Scheduled Actions stability** — keep seed/enrich/embed and digest workflows green across Turso dimension changes and API rate limits.
2. **Recommendation scoring discipline** — tune production weights only when `recommendation-eval` fixture harness stays green across scorer changes.
3. **Weekly alert email delivery** — wire transactional email after in-app digest payloads prove stable in production (in-app first).
4. **Large-library performance** — profile sync, tag, collection, and project recommendation flows for users with 1000+ stars; optimize virtual scroll and API facet paths if needed.
5. **RAG path hardening** — verify knowledgebase binding ingest lag and lexical-only behavior under partial Worker outages.

### Deferred
- Organization/team dashboards and multi-user workspaces.
- General GitHub analytics beyond starred-repo rediscovery.
- Provider expansion beyond GitHub (npm, PyPI, etc.).
- Real-time push notifications for alerts (email/in-app digest first).
- Paid weekly intelligence productization beyond preview surfaces.

### Blocked / Known gaps
- Email delivery for weekly alerts is not wired — digest payloads and inbox exist; SMTP/Resend path is ops-owned next step.
- Recommendation scorer weights are fixture-validated but not yet tuned against large real-user libraries.
- GitHub HTML scraping for star lists is brittle to markup changes — monitor sync error rates.
- knowledgebase Worker dependency is optional; without it, `/api/stars` relevance search falls back to lexical-only results. Turso embeddings remain for non-RAG discover/similar/recommendation features.
